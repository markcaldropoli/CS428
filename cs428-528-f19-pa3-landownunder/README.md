All features work properly. We are having trouble connecting to the httpbin websites. They worked perfectly and then all of a sudden we were not able to access them - we believe we might have been blocked. All of the other example sites work properly and we also tried another external site - http://news.mit.edu/sites/mit.edu.newsoffice/files/styles/news_article_image_top_slideshow/public/images/2019/MIT-implausible-physics_0.jpg which worked as well. Some of the http requests can take up to 30 seconds depending on the size of the content - if it has not been cached.
